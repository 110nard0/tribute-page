    <section id="tribute-intro">
      <p>Chinụalụmọgụ Albert Achebe was a Nigerian novelist, critic, and poet who is hailed as the most dominant figure
        in modern African literature. His literary debut and magnum opus, <em>Things Fall Apart (1958)</em>, is the most
        studied, taught and read African novel and has been in the global spotlight for decades. Achebe resisted
        colonial perspectives which dominated the African consciousness, absorbing influences from the
        intersection of Western and African cultures to create a unique African voice. His writing
        style incorporated the Igbo oral tradition and combined direct narration with folk stories and proverbs which
        were an integral part of his childhood experience.
      </p>

      <p class="quote" id="wood"> <em>"... a magical writer — one of the greatest of the twentieth century"</em></p>

      <p>Achebe acted as an ambassador for the people of the southern region of Biafra when they attempted to secede
        from Nigeria in 1967. As the Nigerian Civil War raged on and as starvation and violence took their toll, he
        played a significant role in liasing with Western nations for support and broadcasting the various war crimes
        and injustices meted out against the Igbo people by the Nigerian government. After the war ended, he had some
        involvement in national politics but quickly became disenchanted by the corruption and nepotism he witnessed. He
        went on to win many important literary prizes and received honorary degrees from more than thirty universities
        all over the world.
